## Simple Erc20 Token

**Import OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 implementation for best practices.**

**Define the token by inheriting from the ERC-20 base contract.**

**Set the total supply and initialize the token with a constructor.**

**Compile, test, and deploy the contract by minting, transferring, and checking balances.**
